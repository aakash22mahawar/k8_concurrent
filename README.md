# Build a Concurrent and Scalable Web Scraper with Playwright, Python, MySQL, Docker, and Kubernetes

## Concurrent Scraping with Playwright and Python:
Use Playwright's asynchronous capabilities to handle multiple web page interactions concurrently in Python, improving scraping speed and efficiency.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data Storage with MySQL:
Store scraped data in a MySQL database for easy querying and management. Use efficient bulk inserts to handle large volumes of data.
```bash
minikube start --cpus=6 --memory=8192
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-storage.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty <mysql_deployment_name> -- /bin/bash
```
create database 'k8' and table name 'books'
```bash
create database k8;
use k8;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    price VARCHAR(50),
    upc VARCHAR(20)
    );
```
## Containerization with Docker:
Package your web scraper, database configurations, and dependencies in Docker containers, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.
```bash
docker pull aakash22mahawar/books_k8:latest
```
## Scalability with Kubernetes:
Deploy your Dockerized scraper to Kubernetes, leveraging its orchestration features to scale pods automatically based on demand and resource usage.
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```bash
kubectl logs -f <pod_name>
```
```bash
kubectl dashboard
```
